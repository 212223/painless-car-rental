# Application specific code is in files that start with an underscore, for exmple:
#
# _network.yaml
# _profiles.yaml

# Service specific code is in files without underscore, example:
#
# nginx-v1.yaml
# php-fpm-v8.yaml

# All files are combined by providing their filenames as a value of the
# variable COMPOSE_FILE, for example:
#
# COMPOSE_FILE=_network.yaml:_restart-policy.yaml ...
#
# in the .env file
